# Grab-Traffic-Management-Challenge

Hi,

The file attached is the solution for the challenge. I used R to compose this solution. 

The solution is divided into 2 parts, labeled as part 1 and part 2. Part 1 is the way I approached the problem, it includes some analysis and visualizations. I also generated some forecasts to get the error rate out of sample.

For part 2, the code is the same as part 1 but there are no visualizations and a test set can be used to assess the accuracy of the model.  

Thanks
